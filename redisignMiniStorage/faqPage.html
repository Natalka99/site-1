        <div class="blockQuestions">
            <h5 style="margin: 0;">How tall are storage units?</h5>
            <p>At MCM Mini Storage, our Climate Controlled Units have 10’ ceilings and the Non-Climate Controlled Units have 9’ ceilings. We purposely made our units taller than average to give you more cubic space inside your storage unit.</p>
            <h5>Do I need climate-controlled storage?</h5>
            <p>Climate control is crucial if you live in an extreme climate or a location prone to swings in temperature. Opt for climate control if you're storing items like leather furniture, antique woods, important documents, photos or electronics.</p>
            <h5>What is climate control?</h5>
            <p>Climate control keeps your belongings safe from extreme temperatures and will protect your items from warping, melting and discoloring. Most facilities that offer climate control will maintain your unit between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            <h5>What are the minimum number of months I can rent?</h5>
            <p>Storage leases are typically month-to-month, so you are not obligated to a set rental length. However, many facilities offer promotions and discounts that require a minimum rental length in order to be redeemed (for example: First month free with two-month minimum). These terms will be detailed above.</p>
            <h5>Do I need a reservation or can I just walk in and rent a space?</h5>
            <p>At MCM Storage facility, we welcome walk-ins and don't require a reservation. However, because prices fluctuate often based on demand and availability, we recommend booking beforehand to secure the unit and price before it changes.</p>
            <h5>How wide are storage unit doors?</h5>
            <p>At MCM Storage we have all Roll-up doors that are comparable to the size of the unit. There are typically six inches on each side between the unit door and the edge of the wall.</p>
            <h5>What is 24-hour access?</h5>
            <p>This means you have the ability to access your storage unit whenever you need to, even when the office is closed.</p>
            <h5>Do storage units have electricity or electrical outlets?</h5>
            <p>At MCM Mini Storage, we do have outlets available for use in the Climate Controlled building while you are here on site; charging your cell phone or listening to a radio while working in your unit. They are not for use when you are not on site.</p>
