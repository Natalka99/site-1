            <h2>
               Welcome to the online home of MCM Mini Storage at MacclennyStorage.com! 
            </h2>
            <p>We are an independently owned company and have been in the lawn and garden and power sports industries since 1999 in Macclenny, Florida.
            We are very excited to introduce the MCM Mini Storage Services now available to the Macclenny and surrounding areas, (including Glen St. Mary, Sanderson, Olustee, Lake Butler, Raiford, Lawtey, etc… in Florida and St. George or Charlton County in Georgia). Come by MCM Outdoor Power Equipment to see us at MCM Mini Storage! The businesses share the same office.</p>
            <p>At MCM Mini Storage, we wanted to ensure that we offer superior storage services, as well as a safe and secure facility for our customers. Our buildings are brand new. We offer both Climate Controlled and Non-Climate Controlled units. Our Non Climate Controlled units include a DripX Moisture Barrier in the ceiling for added protection of your belongings.</p>
            <p>We are using state of the art software to manage your services. Everything is electronic and your payments can be automated for you; 
            less you have to think about each month. With this system, we can also provide several Renter Insurance options as we sign you up to Move In. 
            The insurance is optional, of course.</p>
            <p>The MCM Mini Storage security cameras and security lighting are not your average systems. Our cameras are designed to capture clear images 
            from over 200 feet away. We wanted to do everything possible to keep your belongings stay safe and secure here at MCM Mini Storage. 
            This is why you will enter through a 24/7 access gate with your very own code.</p>
            <p>The MCM Mini Storage facility was designed with wide driving lanes so you can easily drive right up to your outside unit even when pulling 
            a trailer. Our Climate Controlled building has three (3) access doors so you can park close to your indoor storage unit. This will be very helpful 
            during Move In or Move Out.</p>
            <b><p>We at MCM Mini Storage look forward to doing business with you!</p></b>
